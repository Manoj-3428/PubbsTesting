    <string name="about_us">Welcome to PUBBS, your first source for different types of intelligent locks for bicycles in India.
        We are dedicated to providing you with the best public bicycle sharing, concentrating on Hardware Communication, Mobile Management System,
        and Smart Lock Mechanisms. Pubbs is a technology platform for innovative bicycle-sharing to address this last mile problem. It helps people to cover a
        short distance at very negligible costs without waiting. Our dream is to overcome micro-mobility with their bicycle sharing app for the billions of Indians. \n\n\n
        The PUBBS, headed by Professor Debapratim Pandit of  Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, Architecture and Regional Planning, has come a long way since the start
        of its venture. As Mr. Pandit began first, his enthusiasm for greater urban mobility led his team to build this lock that can be used by anyone without any special
        modifications or instructions in order to provide PUBBS with an unforgettable ride. We now serve customers across the country and look forward to transforming our passion
        into our own webpage. We hope you are as happy to offer our products to your customers. Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions or comments. \n\n\n
        We believe in building healthier neighbourhoods that are less congested. Not only is cycling an excellent form of exercise, in some of the most congested cities in the world,
        it is likely to get you quicker. Together, we will create a positive shift in the urban landscape of our city by reducing congestion.

    <string name="login_faq_one">How do an operator login to the system ?</string>
    <string name="login_faq_one_ans">Any level of administrators of Operator/Company should have a particular credential or identification number. Login credentials and password will be sent as
        an sms to the administrator to the particular phone number. Please check your inbox to get the credential details. The login credential be like : Operator Name/Admin level id/Phone Number.</string>
    <string name="login_faq_two">Who will create these credentials ?</string>
    <string name="login_faq_two_ans">Regional Manager(RM) creates and generates identification number and password for Zone Manager(ZM). Zone Manager(ZM) creates and generates identification number
    and password for Area Manager(AM) and Service Manager(SM). Please contact for your credentials to your previous higher level authority.</string>
    <string name="faq_three">What do mean by RM, ZM, AM and SM ?</string>
    <string name="faq_three_ans">Anyone can start Public Bicycle Sharing System business. A company or operator can start the business after buying the bluetooth locks from IIT Kharagpur. An operator or company
    has four hierarchical levels, they are: Regional Manager (RM), Zone Manager (ZM), Area Manager (AM), Service Manager (SM). To distribute the responsibilities Regional Manager creates Zone Manager and Zone Manager
    creates Area Manager and Service Manager.</string>
    <string name="faq_four">What is the pre-defined hierarchical structure of the organisation ?</string>
    <string name="faq_four_ans">IIT Kharagpur has started Public Bicycle Sharing System. This bicycle sharing system can be used as a small business by anyone with low investment. IIT Kharagpur is referred as
    PUBBS or Super Admin. Anyone, who is interested in bicycle sharing system, will be considered as an Operator. The head of the Operator is known as Regional Manager (RM). It will be very difficult for the
        regional manager to monitor if there are more than one areas where bicycle sharing system run. To reduce the work load, Regional Manager(RM) creates Zone Manager(ZM) and give responsibility to
        manage the area as well as bicycle sharing system. To divide this maintenance work load and to spread the business chain, ZM has an option to create Area Manager(AM) and Service Manager(SM).
        ZM adds next level of manager by choosing from the list of areas present in that zone. There may be a point, where the ZM holds back the responsibility from the Area Manager(AM) and
        Service Manager(SM) by deactivating the authority of them.</string>
    <string name="faq_five">What is Zone ? </string>
    <string name="faq_five_ans">A zone is a geographical land having some particular purposes and some restrictions. In this context a city can be considered as a zone where an operator
        can have multiple areas for bicycle sharing system.</string>
    <string name="faq_six">How to create an area ?</string>
    <string name="faq_six_ans">Zone Manager can choose create an area by choosing twelve coordinates/points should be chosen in the map to create the polygon. The area requires some restrictions to follow and run the bicycle sharing system.
       Zone Manager has to set :\n
            \t\t(1) Maximum Ride Time \n\n
            \t\t(2) Maximum Cycle Holding Time\n\n
            \t\t(3) Opening Hour\n\n
            \t\t(4) Closing Hour \n\n</string>
    <string name="faq_seven">How to create a station inside the area ?</string>
    <string name="faq_seven_ans">A twelve points enclosed place is defined as PUBBS area in this case. Zone Manager has to add a station inside the area, where the bicycle users can park the bicycles after the ride.
    To create a station, Zone Manager has to select a point inside the area in the map. This point is considered as station. There are two types of stations, like : Primary Station, Secondary Station. Both have its own
    significances. </string>
    <string name="faq_eight">How the payment structure is imposed after ride complete ? </string>
    <string name="faq_eight_ans">The organisation contains four hierarchical levels. In business context, a small investment can improve a newly launched system and helps in maintenance of that system.
        The bicycle user has to pay a small amount of money to the operator in which the user is registered in to use the bicycle sharing system. Zone Manager creates a monthly or daily or weekly basis plan that
        offers few free rides. This is known as subscription plan. User has to buy a subscription to avail the bicycle ride. Regional Manager is the head of the organisation. Regional Manager
        shares his/her bank UPI ID. All the money transactions of subscription plan occur between the user and the Regional Manager via any payment application present in the user device.
    </string>
    <string name="faq_nine">How to configure the penalties if any violation occurs ? </string>
    <string name="faq_nine_ans">All the bicycles should be parked inside the station. This bicycle sharing system runs within a stipulated time set by the Zone Manager during area creation. This time is called
    Service Hour. It starts in morning and ends at night.(This time may vary according to the Zone Manager). If the user does not return the bicycle to the station and it exceeds the service hour then user has
    pay service hour exceeding fine. All the bicycles need to park in the station and this calls for geo-fencing check. If an user goes out of the station as well as area then user has to pay geo-fencing fine for that.
    An user can ride a bicycle for a particular amount of time and after that user has to return the bicycle to the station so that another user can take the ride of the bicycle. If the user exceeds the maximum
    stipulated ride time then user has to pay maximum ride time exceeding fine for that. User can finish a little work in between the ride without ending it. A Hold feature is introduced in this. User can hold the bicycle for
    a stipulated amount of time and then again resume the ride. If user exceeds the limit of hold ride then an amount of money will be charged as a penalty. All these monetary penalties will be deducted from the subscription plan amount
        and reduces the total amount of subscription plan.</string>
